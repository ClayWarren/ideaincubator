# AI Idea Incubator

A lightweight MVP for turning ideas into action. Submit an idea, get an AI-ranked score, a tweak to improve it, and share it with a mock network—all in a simple web app. Built for GitHub Pages as a static demo, with plans to add real AI and backend features.

## Features
- **Idea Input & Ranking:** Enter an idea (100 words max), get a score (1-10) based on Market Size, Feasibility, and Profit Potential.
- **AI Tweak:** One suggestion to boost your idea’s weakest area.
- **Mock Marketplace:** Simulate sharing with a network (alert-based for now).
- **Dashboard:** View your ideas, scores, and tweaks.
